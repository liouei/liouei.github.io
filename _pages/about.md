I am an optical physicist specialized in **optics and photonics**, **high-power fiber lasers**, **laser power stabilization**, **precision interferometry** with **optical cavities**, and the **numerical modelling of electromagnetic waves**. I have been applying my optics background to large-scale experiments that address some of the most fundamental questions in physics, the detection of gravitational waves, on earth and in space, and the nature of the Dark Matter.

I am currently leading the optical verification activities of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space mission at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hannover, Germany: the optical fiber backlink (phase reference distribution system) engineering model, and the quadrant photo-receiver â€” phase meter (signal detection and processing chain) engineering model with a hexagon interferometer.  

Previously I have held a fellowship position to work on the **Any Light Particle Search II (ALPS II) experiment at the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY)** in Hamburg that features high-power lasers, high-finesse optical cavities, single-photon counting detectors and superconducting dipole magnets. The ALPS II experiment searches for hypothetical **axion-like particles** that can shed light on the **strong CP problem in particle physics** as well as the nature of the **Dark Matter** if detected. 

For my doctoral researches, I worked on the high-power laser system for the **Advanced Virgo gravitational wave detector** that features the coherent combination of fiber laser amplifiers and laser power stabilization with high-photocurrent photodiode arrays. I am the co-author of the paper reporting the **first direct observation of gravitational waves** in 2015 and am among the awardee of the **2016 Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics**.
